# WGU_openstreetmap

## Files:
* Submission_Document.html - the submission document, in html format, and cleaned a bit from the jupyer notebook's presentation
* openstreetmap.ipynb - the jupyter notebook used to create the submission document
* open_street_main.py - the main file python file that called all the imports, called the functions, and made the csv files
* processing_funcs.py - the python file that held all the functions
* gordon_county.xml - the OSM XML file I used for this project
* *.csv - all the csv files created using the python files to extract the data from the .xml file
* schema.sql - the adapted schema I used (the original was provided by Udacity). I had to change it as a lof of the column names were SQL reserved names.
* database_dump.sql - the dump of the DB I created for the project

***

## Important:
The bulk of the python work was done in the two .py files. The jupyter notebook was only used to help present the data.
